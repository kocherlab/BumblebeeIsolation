## Body Posture Embedding

We used the technique described in "Mapping the stereotyped behaviour of freely-moving fruit flies‚Äù by Berman, GJ, Choi, DM, Bialek, W, and Shaevitz, JW, J. Royal Society Interface, 99, 20140672 (2014). See https://github.com/gordonberman/MotionMapper for details.

## Compositional Data Analysis

Our composition data analysis is based on "Cerebellar contributions to a brainwide network for flexible behavior" by Verpeut, JL, Bergeler, S, Kislin, M, Townes, FW, Klibaite, U, Dhanerwala, ZM, Hoag, A, Jung, C, Lee, J, Pisano, TJ, Seagraves, KM, Shaevitz, JW, and Wang, SS-H, bioRxiv (2021).
